we got the technicals, in place, lets work on the code editor ,
i ned a vs code like editor on my website with files and folder options on the left,
a code write in the center and a terminal in the bottom , a top panel with basic navigation optiosn,
some key optiosn like run, rename, publsih, files, etc  and a chat bot on the right for help in coding 
( i will add it on my own),
 the terminal can be sued for installing key libraries, essential for the advance fucntioning,
code editor is liek normal vs code, only differance when creaitng files, the user needs to click indicaot, 
stratey or library , adn shoudl be saved with a unique file format like .in, .st and .lib, can you help me do that,
these can be svae don the the users pc,
 lets also allow users to create .py python files for settign up the modules and libraries they downlaoded and then suing
  them in our language for their stratregies, indicators, etc, complex right?
   lets create another folder in devscript anmed editor, lets create fiels in that and link all these in there,
    note things like terminal is already a part of this inter-pine fodler so we will jsut use it there,
 is there any installation libraries that allow our project to made faster , lets get going, elts go
